# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns

## Overview of the Project
### Background
Louise has been involved in fundraising campaigns and have the data set compiled for all the campaigns that she has done so far. Right now, she noticed that one of her plays Fever reached the goal in very short amount of time. This has made her curious some research and find out if there is any relation between the amount of goal set for fundraising campaign and its outcome (whether it was successful, cancelled, or failed). Moreover, she is also looking for the relationship between one of her campaign categories i.e.  theatre and launch date of the campaign.
### Purpose

The purpose of this analysis it to help Louise determine relationships between the fund outcomes and goals & between campaign launch dates and their respective outcomes so that she can better plan for the campaigns next time.



## Analysis & Challenges
### Relation between Outcome with respect to their set goals.
To discover the relationship between the outcome of the campaign based on the goals, the basic line chart was drawn using excel with range of amount set for goal on x-axis and its respective percentage for the outcomes (successful, failed & cancelled) on the y-axis.

### Relationship between outcome of the campaign & its launch month
The determine the relationship between the two variables again, the line chart was used with month of the year on x-axis and its outcome (successful, failed & cancelled) count on the y-axis.

## Results
### Conclusion for goal amount to be set for campaign.
The chart shows that there is strong relationship between these two variables. The campaign amount with goal set to the range of 45,000 to 49,999 failed totally. All of the campaigns between this range were failed with not even a single campaign success. The best range to set the goal for the campaign is less than 1000 with the highest probability of success. 
### Conclusion for the best time of the year to launch the campaign.
The chart shows the interesting relationship between the outcome of the theatre campaign and its launch time (month) of the year, based on which we can draw the below conclusions.
1.	The best time to launch the theatre campaign is the month of May (start of the summer) and the worst time to launch the theatre campaign is the month of December (winter). The weather is the most significant factor in determining the success of the campaign because people enjoy being outdoor in summer and prefer to stay indoors during the winter.
2.	The campaign failures hovered around 30% to 50% throughout the period in consideration.
Limitation of the dataset.
The analysis of the outcomes based on launch dates shows that none of the plays were cancelled in the month of Oct. We can see as unexplained difference which needs further investigation to find out the reason behind this. Our dataset doesn not have any variable to justify this.

### Recommendations
The relation between the variables in the datasets could have been better explained if the descriptive analysis of the data set was mentioned.  Moreover, the box and whisper plot could have been used to visualize the outliers present in the dataset along with percentiles and mean.
