# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns

## Background:

Louise has been involved in fundraising campaings and have the data set compiled for all the campaigns that she has done so far. Right now, she notice that one of her plays **Fever** reached the goal in very short amount of time. This has made her curious some research and find out if there is any relation between the amount of goal set for fundraising campaign and its outcome (whether it was successful, canceled, or failed). Moreoever, she is also looking for the relationship between one of her campaign categoriesi.e. theater and launch date of the campaign.
